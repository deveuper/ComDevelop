Simple Physics Toolkit - Magnet, Water, Wind - VR Ready 1.3
所支持的Unity版本：5.3.4 及以上版本
Some simple physics manipulation scripts: 

Simply drag these scripts onto a game object with a collider component attached and watch it do the rest. 

New November 2017 - We have just added a new realism mode for the magnet script which attempts to obey Newton's second law. 

Additionally to this we have also added a simple propulsion system called the Thruster Engine. This system allows you to create simple rockets, and ships using multiple thrusters, and includes a very simple hover mode which will allow ships to hover over terrain. (BETA) 

Our Projectile system now also includes an object spawn limit for automated scene cleanup. 

Lastly, we have also added some custom inspector windows to streamline development on the more complex scripts, and included a few new gizmo icons. 

Note: All scripts have been tested in VR (Virtual Reality) scenes, by ourselves and some users of the asset, we are therefore happy to say that this asset is now VR Ready
